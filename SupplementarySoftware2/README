SILENCING DREAM5 DATASETS

In a Matlab workspace run the program: RUN.m

The program uploads all Gij matrices from the directory INPUT/Predictions.
It silences all Gij matrices using the code SILENCING.m
The output (Gij and Sij) is saved to the directory PREDICTIONS 
(only top scoring 100,000 links are saved from Gij and Sij).
The code then reads the the predctions from the directory PREDICTIONS and uses 
the DREAM5 evaluation script to score them.
The DREAM5 evaluation codes appear in directory DREAM5Codes, and the scoring of
all methods is saved to the directory SCORES.
