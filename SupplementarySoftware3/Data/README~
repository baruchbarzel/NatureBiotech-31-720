ANALYSIS OF THE E. COLI NETWORK

The expression data was treated as follows:

Starting with M, a 805*4511 matrix describing the 
mRNA levels of 4511 genes under 805 different conditions.

First I subtracted the average expression level of each 
gene accross the 805 conditions from the relevant term:

Mij ----> Mij - <Mij>_j 

Then I used the exponent of the resulting terms to account for the
actual perturbation (not the Logged one):

Mij ----> e^(Mij)

I then used Pearson correlations to obtain Gij:

For each Trascription Factor s (s = 1:141), 
I caclculated the correlation with all 
4511 remaining genes:

Gsj = corrcoef(M(:,s), M(:,j)).

For the diagoinal I used Gii = 1 for all i = 1:4511.

I used the SIlencer to transform G to S.

And claclulated Analysis:

Analysis = [Precentile, Recall, Precision, TPR, FPR]

For E. Coli: 

G_AUROC = 0.5 + 0.0995
S_AUROC = 0.5 + 0.1374
 
Silencing Ratio:

G = [1, 0.6369]
S = [1, 0.2786]
