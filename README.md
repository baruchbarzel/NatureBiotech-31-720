## Supplementary Data and Code for Silencing Method

Included are 3 software packages. Each package includes a README instructions file, as well as in-line instructions in the Matlab code. 

**Please cite: "Network link prediction by global silencing of indirect correlations", Nature Biotechnology 31, 720-725 (2013).**

- Supplementary Software 1 – Code (Matlab), SILENCING.m, for executing the silencing transformation. Takes a square link prediction matrix G_ij as input and produces a silenced S_ij matrix as output.

- Supplementary Software 2 – All required code and data for reproducing the results presented in Fig. 1 of correspondence.

- Supplementary Software 3 – This software package reproduces the results of Fig. 3 in "Network link prediction by global silencing of indirect correlations", Nature Biotechnology 31, 720-725 (2013). **The silencing algorithm appears in SMatrix.m. Since publication the authors have identified several problems with the implementation used in this code, and produced an improved code. For general application of the method please use the improved code: SILENCING.m in SUPPLEMENTARY SOFTWARE 1 and 2.**
